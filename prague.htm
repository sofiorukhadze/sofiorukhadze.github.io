						<p align="main-bottom-left"> SinceI have heard stories about its beauty, its old bridges and cathedrals have been on my mind, I have always had one thought: Prague was the most beautiful town in Europe.<br>
													So on my first year of studying in Europe I decided to spend my spring break in this magical place and finally make my big dream come true.</br>
													Prague is the best place for art, music and literature lovers. The beautiful colors of its sall old town remind you of the paintings by Van Gogh.<br>
													Prague smells like beer, oil and Trdelnik (spit cake) and there is music, music everywhere. Every corner is full of street musicians who try to play their best songs.</br> 
													Charles bridge, Kafka museum, astronomical clock and many old cathedrals are the main attractions you should defifinitely see during your stay. </br>
													If you want to see the real beauty of Charles bridge, do not hesitate to wake up a bit earlier and take a walk through empty bridge. Prague will bring music and culture to your soul. <br>
													It will fill you with eternal happiness which will follow you everywhere as you will remember that you spent several days in Prague. </br>
